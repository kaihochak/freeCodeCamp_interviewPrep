# freeCodeCamp_interviewPrep

WHY DID I START THIS?

After two years of studying computer science in two universities, I felt like I knew nothing about programming at all but only some theoretical knowledge and mathematics. Though I have experience working with several programming languages, I have never been able to create anything. Most projects I did were just school assignments. So I decided to learn javascript which seems to be the most frequently used especially for web programming. Instead of learning it from scratch, I think it would be a better way to learn it by jumping straight to some coding interview questions since I already had much programming experience.  

WHAT ARE THESE?

I started to work on the "coding interview prep" section on freeCodeCamp.org. Since I didn't really know how to write in javascript, I would simply try to write some pseudocode. Then, I jump right into the model answer provided by freeCodeCamp and try to twist it a little bit or simply add some comment in order to make it more like the way I would do it. By doing that, I could save some time while learning how to use the language itself.
